		<p>"Celestial Switch" was my most recent Game Jam I participated in for the Unreal Engine Mega Jam. In this game you wall run and double jump while switching between forms to navigate levels in a speedrunning fashion. This game was made in Unreal Engine and the majority of the game code and implementation of the art assets was done by me. The game uses perlin noise for many of its materials and features music that switches seamlessly between 2 different instrimental versions.</p></body>

	"Cruise Control" was my final University Project created for my Game Programming II course. In this game you are tasked with driving along a randomly generated highway for as long as you can while dealing with distractions along the way. This game was built in Unity and although it's scope had to be scaled back for time, the core concept is still present in the final build.

		<p>"Wave Sword Fighter" was my first Unreal Engine game that I made to participate in the 2022 GameDev.tv Game Jam. In this game you try to get as far as you can to rack up the highest score. If your power level is high enough, you'll power up upon death instead of dying for a chance to comeback.</p></body>

		<p>"It's Ya Boid" was my final project for Game Programming I and was made to demonstrate a boid model in Unity.
		In this game, you control a group of bees (Boids) with the goal of getting the highest score you can in the given time.
		The longer you collect pollen, the more bees that will join your swarm, until you hit a cap of 100. The more bees you have in your swarm,
		the more pollen you can gather.

		<p>While at Brain Evolved I built a variety of Javascript games in the Phaser 3 Engine. I have examples of some Games Built in Phaser 2 on my Github.</p>
