		<p>"Wave Sword Fighter" was my first Unreal Engine game that I made to participate in the 2022 GameDev.tv Game Jam. In this game you try to get as far as you can to rack up the highest score. If your power level is high enough, you'll power up upon death instead of dying for a chance to comeback.</p></body>

		<p>Cruise Control was my final University Project created for my Game Programming II course. In this game you are tasked with driving along a randomly generated highway for as long as you can while dealing with distractions along the way. This game was built in Unity and although it's scope had to be scaled back for time, the core concept is still present in the final build.</p>

		<p>"It's Ya Boid" was my final project for Game Programming I and was made to demonstrate a boid model in Unity.
		In this game, you control a group of bees (Boids) with the goal of getting the highest score you can in the given time.
		The longer you collect pollen, the more bees that will join your swarm, until you hit a cap of 100. The more bees you have in your swarm,
		the more pollen you can gather.
