		<p>"It's Ya Boid" was my final project for Game Programming I and was made to demonstrate a boid model in Unity.
		In this game, you control a group of bees (Boids) with the goal of getting the highest score you can in the given time.
		The longer you collect pollen, the more bees that will join your swarm, until you hit a cap of 100. The more bees you have in your swarm,
		the more pollen you can gather.
